## Graph use case in MongoDB 

In this repo you'll learn how to implement a graph use case in MongoDB Atlas through 3 examples.

<p> Atlas Search Store implements many Atlas Search features from autocomplete to custom function scoring. Using the $search operator in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline, we can build fine-grained searches across text, numerics, and geospatial data. By building out this application, you'll learn all sorts of ways MongoDB allows you to build complex, fine-grained full-text searches on your Atlas data.</p>

**No additional servers or software needed. No need to keep data in sync. Everything is done in MongoDB Atlas.**

Current features implemented in this e-commerce application include:

- fuzzy matching
- highlighting
- autocomplete
- relevance-based scoring
- custom function scoring

Future Atlas Search features to implement can include:

- [ ] range queries
- [ ] facets
- [ ] synonyms

<p>This application was created using:</p>

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- MongoDB Realm for backend HTTPs endpoints and webhooks
- A sample dataset of Amazon products

<h3>API Points of Integration</h3>
This application is hosted entirely on Realm and calls 2 API endpoints:
 
 * getProductsEndpoint in the Home.js page on line 24
 * Suggestions_AC_Endpoint, used for autocompleted product names, in the Header.js component on line 17.
